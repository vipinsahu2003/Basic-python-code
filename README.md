# Python Programming Fundamentals

This repository includes beginner Python scripts focusing on basic concepts, control structures, functions, modules, file handling, and data structures.

## Basic Concepts

- **Mathematical Operations:**  
  Prompts the user for two numbers, calculates and displays their sum, difference, product, and division. Demonstrates arithmetic operators and simple input/output.

- **Personalized Greeting:**  
  Takes first and last name input, combines them, and prints a greeting message to the user.

### How to Run These Programs

1. Make sure Python is installed.
2. Open terminal/command prompt.
3. Navigate to the script directory.
4. Run each program using:
    ```
    python task1_basic_math.py
    python task2_greeting.py
    ```

## Control Structures

- **Even/Odd Number Checker:**  
  Asks for an integer input and uses an if-else statement to check if the number is even or odd.

- **Sum of Numbers (1 to 50):**  
  Calculates and prints the sum of all integers from 1 to 50 using a for loop.

### How to Run These Programs

1. Confirm Python is installed.
2. Open terminal/command prompt and go to the project directory.
3. Run the scripts using:
    ```
    python check_even_odd.py
    python sum_1_to_50.py
    ```

## Functions & Modules

- **Factorial Calculator:**  
  Defines a function to calculate the factorial of a number using recursion or loops.

- **Math Module Calculations:**  
  Uses Python's built-in math module to compute square root, natural logarithm, and sine of a user-entered number.

### How to Run These Programs

1. Ensure Python is installed.
2. Open terminal/command prompt.
3. Navigate to the project folder.
4. Run the scripts with:
    ```
    python factorial_function.py
    python math_module_calculations.py
    ```

## Files, Exceptions, and Errors

- **Read File with Error Handling:**  
  Opens and reads a file named `sample.txt`. Prints its contents line by line and handles errors if the file does not exist.

- **Write and Append Data to a File:**  
  Takes user input to write to a file, appends additional data, then reads and displays the complete file contents.

### How to Run These Programs

1. Verify Python is installed on your system.
2. Open terminal or command prompt and navigate to your project folder.
3. Execute:
    ```
    python read_file.py
    python write_append_file.py
    ```

## Data Structures and Strings

- **Student Marks Lookup:**  
  Implements a dictionary where student names are keys and their marks are values. The user can input a student's name to retrieve marks, with proper handling for missing entries.

- **List Slicing Demonstration:**  
  Creates a list of numbers from 1 to 10, extracts the first five elements, reverses them, and displays both the extracted and reversed lists.

### How to Run These Programs

1. Make sure Python is installed.
2. Open terminal/command prompt and go to the project folder.
3. Run the scripts using:
    ```
    python student_marks_dictionary.py
    python list_slicing_demo.py
    ```
