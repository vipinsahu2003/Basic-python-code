# Assignment 1 - Module 2: Basic Python Concepts

This repository contains solutions for Assignment 1 from Module 2, which focuses on basic Python programming concepts such as input/output, arithmetic operations, and string manipulation.

## Task 1: Basic Mathematical Operations
The Task 1 program prompts the user to enter two numbers. It then performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division on these numbers and displays each result. This task demonstrates the use of variables, arithmetic operators, and basic input/output functions in Python.

## Task 2: Personalized Greeting
The Task 2 program asks the user to input their first and last names, concatenates these to form a full name, and prints a personalized greeting message. This task is a practical example of string operations and user interaction through input and output.

## How to Run the Programs
1. Ensure Python is installed on your system.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the folder containing the Python scripts.
4. Run the programs individually by executing the following commands:
   - For Task 1:
     ```
     python task1_basic_math.py
     ```
   - For Task 2:
     ```
     python task2_greeting.py
     ```
5. Follow the prompts displayed on the screen.

## Notes
- These programs use basic Python concepts covered in the course.
- Error handling is minimal to maintain focus on fundamental concepts.
- The scripts serve as an introduction to Python programming fundamentals.
