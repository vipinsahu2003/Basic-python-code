# Python Programming Fundamentals

This repository includes beginner Python scripts focusing on basic concepts and control structures.

## Module 2: Basic Concepts

- **Mathematical Operations:**  
  Prompts the user for two numbers, calculates and displays their sum, difference, product, and division. Demonstrates arithmetic operators and simple input/output.

- **Personalized Greeting:**  
  Takes first and last name input, combines them, and prints a greeting message to the user.

### How to Run These Programs

1. Make sure Python is installed.
2. Open terminal/command prompt.
3. Navigate to the script directory.
4. Run each program using:
    ```
    python task1_basic_math.py
    python task2_greeting.py
    ```

## Module 3: Control Structures

- **Even/Odd Number Checker:**  
  Asks for an integer input and uses an if-else statement to check if the number is even or odd.

- **Sum of Numbers (1 to 50):**  
  Calculates and prints the sum of all integers from 1 to 50 using a for loop.

### How to Run These Programs

1. Confirm Python is installed.
2. Open terminal/command prompt and go to the project directory.
3. Run the scripts using:
    ```
    python check_even_odd.py
    python sum_1_to_50.py
    ```

**Note:**  
Each script is designed for simple, interactive learning and focuses on the basic principles of Python programming.
